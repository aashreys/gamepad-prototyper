Prototyper is a Figma plugin that allows you to automatically create gamepad navigation prototypes such as moving through a grid of items with the D-Pad or Left Stick.

This is a BETA release and currently only supports D-Pad and Left Stick navigation with an Xbox Controller. Support for more navigation inputs such as Trigger/Shoulder buttons and Playstation controllers coming soon.

While in BETA, I'm actively looking for feedback to improve the plugin. If you have any thoughts you'd like to share, please shoot me an email at aashrey9sharma@gmail.com.
